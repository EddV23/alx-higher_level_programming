# 0x0B. Python - Input/Output

## Python Input/Output Project

### Overview

This project delves into the realm of Input/Output (I/O) in Python. It encompasses a series of tasks aimed at honing your skills in reading from and writing to files, manipulating file objects, and understanding various modes and formats associated with I/O operations in Python.

### Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Grasp the basics of Input/Output in Python
- Read and write data to files using built-in functions
- Understand file modes such as read, write, and append
- Work with text and binary files
- Use the `with` statement for file handling
- Implement exception handling for I/O operations
- Format strings and data while reading and writing files

### Project Structure

The project is divided into tasks, each addressing specific aspects of Python Input/Output. These tasks cover reading from and writing to files, manipulating file contents, and dealing with exceptions during I/O operations.

### Tasks

0. **Read File**
   - [0-read_file.py](0-read_file.py): Write a function to read a text file and print its contents to the standard output.

1. **Number of Lines**
   - [1-number_of_lines.py](1-number_of_lines.py): Write a function to return the number of lines in a text file.

2. **Read Specific Line**
   - [2-read_lines.py](2-read_lines.py): Write a function to read and print specific lines from a text file.

3. **Write to a File**
   - [3-write_file.py](3-write_file.py): Write a function to write a string to a text file and return the number of characters written.

4. **Append to a File**
   - [4-append_write.py](4-append_write.py): Write a function to append a string to the end of a text file and return the number of characters added.

5. **Create a File**
   - [5-to_json_string.py](5-to_json_string.py): Write a function to convert an object to its JSON representation.

6. **From JSON String to Object**
   - [6-from_json_string.py](6-from_json_string.py): Write a function to convert a JSON string to an object.

7. **Save Object to a File**
   - [7-save_to_json_file.py](7-save_to_json_file.py): Write a function to save an object to a JSON file.

8. **Load Object from a File**
   - [8-load_from_json_file.py](8-load_from_json_file.py): Write a function to load an object from a JSON file.

9. **Add Item to a CSV**
    - [9-add_item.py](9-add_item.py): Write a script that adds all arguments to a Python list and saves them to a file.

10. **Class to JSON**
    - [10-class_to_json.py](10-class_to_json.py): Write a function to return the dictionary description of a simple data structure (class instance).

11. **Student to JSON**
    - [11-student.py](11-student.py): Implement a `Student` class with methods to retrieve a dictionary representation of an instance.

12. **Student to JSON with Filter**
    - [12-student.py](12-student.py): Enhance the `Student` class to include a method that filters attributes when converting to a dictionary.

13. **Append After**
    - [100-append_after.py](100-append_after.py): Write a function to insert a line of text to a file after each line containing a specific string.

14. **Write to a UTF-8 File**
    - [101-stats.py](101-stats.py): Write a script to read from `stdin` and compute metrics for each 10 lines and after a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C).


### Requirements

- Python Scripts: Use allowed editors (vi, vim, emacs), Python 3.8.5, and follow coding style using pycodestyle.
- Python Test Cases: Use allowed editors, write test files in the `tests` directory, and ensure proper documentation.
- Documentation: Include README.md, module, class, and function documentation using proper sentences.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-higher_level_programming.git
    cd alx-higher_level_programming/0x0B-python-input_output
    ```

2. Execute the Python scripts:

    ```bash
    ./0-main.py
    ./1-main.py
    # ... (execute other main files as needed)
    ```

3. Run the test cases:

    ```bash
    python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
    ```
