## Overview

This repository contains solution files for a set of Python exercises related to the topic "Everything is Object" in the context of high-level programming.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **alx-higher_level_programming/0x09-python-everything_is_object/**
  - **0-answer.txt**: Answer to the question "Who am I?". The function used to get the type of an object is `type`.
  - **1-answer.txt**: Answer to the question "Where are you?". The function used to get the variable identifier is `id`.
  - **2-answer.txt to 28-answer.txt**: Answers to various questions related to object identity and equality.
